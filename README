This little hack adapts fabricate.py to generic 'cache'.

See http://code.google.com/p/fabricate/ for more details about original fabricate.py.

Invoke something that takes time and is deterministic in files that it reads like this:

fabricate.py ./autogen.sh

This tool tracks dependencies of command and caches it's output
files. If dependencies are same it just copies outputs from cache
without running command.

Very handy for those long and non-parallelizable autotools runs!

The code is quite quick & dirty. Largely because my interest for doing
anything in Python is zero. Feel free to fork and improve.
